#puts is the equivalent of console.log in JS, a hashtag is used to comment out lines of code in ruby.
#space needs to exist when using p otherwise you will get an error
#puts places a break in between each line used, so displaying an Array with puts will render it with breaks rather than an Array.
#pp is a better way to print out complex data, like nested arrays and hashes
#hashes are rubys equivalent to objects in JavaScript.
#IRB is ruby's version of REPL where we can enter lines of code in the terminal and it will run.
#when running puts in IRB you will receive two lines of code, the value printed and a value called => nil, which is the equivilant to null meaning no value.

# puts "hello, world!"
# puts "hello, world!"
# puts "hello, world!"

# p [1, 2, 3]

# pp [{ id: 1, hello: "World!" }, { id: 2, hello: "Ruby"}, {id: 3, hello: "Moon"}, { id: 4, hello: "Learner"}]

puts "Hello World!"
print "Pass this test, please."
p [1,2,3]
